# Youtube Clickbaitify

This extension adds clickbait on top of all YouTube thumbnails.
If you want to add more images, fork this repository, add the images to the images folder (with the same naming convention), and submit a pull request.

This is a fork of the Mrbeastify extension made for High Seas and Browser Buddy Hack Club
